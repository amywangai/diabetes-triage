./scripts/train_and_run.sh
```

## ðŸš€ Final Deployment Steps

1. Ensure all code is committed and pushed
2. Create and push v0.1 tag
3. Verify v0.1 release in GitHub
4. Create v0.2 improvements
5. Create and push v0.2 tag
6. Verify v0.2 release in GitHub
7. Test both Docker images locally
8. Create hand-in PDF with repository URL
